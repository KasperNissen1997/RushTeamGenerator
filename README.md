# Rush Team Generator
This application was developed for Rush Copenhagen, a tournament organizer residing in Copenhagen, DK. Rush Copenhagen has since been dissolved, so any part of the program can be used freely.

## Purpose
The application aims to generate the most balanced teams possible, by distributing players based on their percieved skill level. The players have associated inclusions and exclusions, so that relations between players can be created - fx. if a player wishes to play with another specific player, they will be teamed up together, and vice versa.

## Final notes
The program was not finished, but is left perpetually in a state of incompleteness. The algorithm for generating the teams is the sole reason this project is still visible.
